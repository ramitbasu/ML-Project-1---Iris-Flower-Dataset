# ML-Beginner-Project---Iris-Flower-Dataset

# Iris Classification Project

This project involves classifying iris flowers into different species using the Iris dataset. The goal is to build and evaluate various machine learning models to predict the species of iris flowers based on their measurements.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Iris dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/iris.csv). It contains 150 observations of iris flowers with the following columns:
- `sepal-length`: Length of the iris sepal in cm.
- `sepal-width`: Width of the iris sepal in cm.
- `petal-length`: Length of the iris petal in cm.
- `petal-width`: Width of the iris petal in cm.
- `class`: Species of the iris (target variable). The species belong to one of the following three categories:
  - Setosa
  - Versicolor
  - Virginica

## Goal

The goal of this project is to identify the species of a new iris flower based on its measurements.

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
